## Introduction

A spoofer is software that changes the serial numbers and physical addresses assigned to your hardware. This change helps you remain undetected by games and other software that track these identifiers. 

This repository provides a straightforward method to avoid hardware bans in Fortnite and other popular games. 

## Features

- **Bypass Hardware Bans**: Effectively change your hardware identifiers to avoid detection.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple commands make it easy to use.
- **Compatibility**: Works with multiple games, including Fortnite and Valorant.
- **Regular Updates**: Stay up to date with the latest methods and fixes.

2. Download the appropriate file for your system.

## Usage

After installation, follow these steps to use the FortniteSpoofer:

## How It Works

The FortniteSpoofer alters hardware identifiers, making it difficult for games to track your device. It randomizes the serial numbers and physical addresses that games read when you start them. 

This method helps you avoid bans, especially after previous infractions. However, please remember that using spoofers can carry risks, including potential account bans if detected.

## Important Notes
